# CameoCodeToCSV
Simple Java application to download the GDELT Cameo Codes, parse the code into its intended hierarchy and convert to CSV format

This code is free to use for any purpose with or without credit.  Have at it.  If you improve it though, feel free to PR it.  I'd like to get some more utility code for interacting with the GDELT dataset.

To use it, simply:

`git clone git@github.com:intellnet/Cameo2Csv.git`
`mvn clean package`.
`java -jar target/CameoToCSV-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
